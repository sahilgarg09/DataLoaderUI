# SpringbotAngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.


## Getting started
use the Angular CLI tool to accelerate development, while adhering to the Style Guide recommendations that benefit every Angular project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js® and an npm package manager.

## STEP 1: Install Node.js
Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

To get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Download the LTS version for your OS.


## Step 2: Install the Angular CLI
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

content_copy
npm install -g @angular/cli

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
